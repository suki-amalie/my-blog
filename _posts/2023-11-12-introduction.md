### Hi, I'm Jash!

I love **mathematics** and **problem solving**.

In recent years, I started applying my passion for math and problem solving into computational problems.

I'm currently pursuing bachelor of computer science at Monash university.

The last 3 months was grueling, I learned a lot of fundamentals low level concept about computer like the computer system, the amsembly code, the operating system,.. and also high level concepts like algorithm and data structure. 

I was exposed to a lot of possible learning path. In the applied math session for continuous mathematics, I met **professor Daniel Schmidt** - a very enthusiastic and unhinged human being when teaching about matrices, interpolation and function approximation using Taylor series. 

He usually came to class with his jupyter notebook in VS code, showing us his models for some of the functions covered in class. He also went above and beyond class topics like finding the identity matrix of a non-uniform matrix, the sigmoid function used in logistic expression, the confidence interval, partial derivative functions descripting the rate of change of a chair in 3D space (our classroom). 

I thoroughly enjoyed his applied class and this is the only class that I never missed. Next year, I'm going to take the computational modeling unit taught by professor Daniel Schmidt and see where this will take me!
