### Hi, I'm Jash!

I love **mathematics** and **problem solving**.

In recent years, I started applying my passion for math and problem solving into computational problems.

I'm currently pursuing bachelor of computer science at Monash university.

The last 3 months was grueling, I learned a lot of fundamentals low level concept about computer like the computer system, the amsembly code, the operating system,.. and also high level concepts like algorithm and data structure. 

I was exposed to a lot of possible learning path. In the applied math session for continuous mathematics, I met the associate professor **Simon Teshuva** - a very enthusiastic and unhinged human being when teaching about matrices, interpolation and function approximation using Taylor series. 

He usually came to class with his jupyter notebook in VS code, showing us his models for some of the functions covered in class. He also went above and beyond class topics like finding the identity matrix of a non-uniform matrix, the sigmoid function used in logistic expression, the confidence interval, partial derivative functions descripting the rate of change of the motion of a chair in 3D space (our classroom). 

I thoroughly enjoyed his applied class and this is the only class that I never missed. I love to be gaslighted with hard puzzling complex subjects because once I built a way to understand them even surfacely, I felt imense gratitude and satisfaction (also felt 1 IQ smarter).

Next year, I'm going to take computational modelling and simulation. It's a 3rd year unit but I'm excited to be challenged. Moreover, it's taught by an exotic human being.
